C++ for Scientific Computing
----------------------------

The Dune framework is written in modern C++ - mastering Dune will also
require expertise in C++. However, providing a full blown introduction
to C++ is out of scope of this course. We do however provide this lecture
that highlights some aspects of modern C++ that we consider important
for Scientific Computing and for using Dune.

The lecture is split into three parts that you can watch below.

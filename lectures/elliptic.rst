Elliptic Problems
-----------------

This lecture will introduce you to the discretization framework dune-pdelab.
The lecture is split in two parts. In a first part, we will study the typical
model problem: *P1 finite elements for Poisson equation*. In a second part,
we will study common generalizations of this model problem, like arbitrary
polynomial degree, quadrilateral meshes, nonlinearities etc.

The recording of the first lecture about *P1 finite elements for Poisson equation* is available below.
A written form of this tutorial is available :download:`for download <../pdfs/tutorial00.pdf>`.
You can also :download:`download the lecture slides <../pdfs/tutorial00_slides.pdf>`.

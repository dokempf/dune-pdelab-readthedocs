Introduction to Finite Elements
-------------------------------

This course focusses on solving PDEs with the Finite Element Method.
Similar to the :ref:`Introduction to C++ <cppintro>`, a rigorous derivation
of the Finite Element Method is out of scope of this course. We do however
reiterates all of the basic elements of the method that are relevant for
its implementation.

We strongly recommend you watching this introduction even if you are already
familiar with the Finite Element Method, as the lecture not only introduces
the mathematical concepts, it also introduces the mathematical formulations
and notation that we will be using during the rest of the course.

The lecture is split into two parts:
